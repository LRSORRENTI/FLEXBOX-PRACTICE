    <h1>
      These are notes I'll be taking for Vishwas Gopinath Udemy course, it's a
      short course but I'm looking forward to improving my flexbox skills
    </h1>
    <h2 class="mb-3">Course intro</h2>
    <p>
      Up first we'll go over what flexbox is, then in the rest of the course
      we'll practice using flexbox to built layouts
    </p>

    <h3>So what is flexbox?</h3>
    <p>
      The CSS flexible box module aka FLEXBOX is a one-dimensional 
      layout model that makes it easy to:
      <div class="parent">
        <ul>
        <li>
Design flexible and efficient layouts
      </li>
      <li>
        Distribute space among items
      </li>
      <li>
        Control their alignment in a given container
      </li>
    </ul>  
   
    </p>

    <p>
      Before flexbox there were four layout modes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <u>BLOCK</u> - For sections on a webpage
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>
          Inline
        </u>
         - For text
        
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>
          Table</u> - For two-dimensional table data
        
      </li>
      <li>
      <u>
        Positioned - 
      </u>
      For explicit position of an element
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But these layouts did not provide enough flexibility, we 
      used to have to use all sorts of 'hacks' to get the layout 
      the way we wanted, working with FLOATS, trying to VERTICALLY 
      ALIGN the content, creating EQUAL HEIGHT COLUMNS, kind've a 
      nightmare
    </p>
    <p>
      BOOTSTRAP is build on top of the flex layout, and FLEXBOX 
      itself is crucial to know for front-end developers in order 
      to style pages responsively
    </p>
    <p>Why flexbox?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Lot's of flexibility
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange items more efficiently
      </li>
      <li>
        Provide superior spacing
      </li>
      <li>
        Help maintain proper alignment and order of items
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
     <u> TERMINOLOGY: </u>
    </h2>
<p>
  When we talk about flexbox, we mainly mean two entities:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <u>
      FLEX-CONTAINER: Our main flex space
    </u>
  </li>
  <li>
    <u>
      FLEX-ITEMS: The immediate children elements of the flex container
    </u>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  For ex: if we have 'div class='container' and inside we have < div > 
  item 1 < / div > the 'item 1' is the flex-item, and the div class is 
  our flex container
</p>
<p>
  Now we also deal with FLEXBOX AXES
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    MAIN AXIS, or X AXIS WHICH RUNS LEFT TO RIGHT ON OUR SCREEN
  </li>
  <li>
    CROSS AXIS, or Y AXIS WHICH RUNS TOP TO BOTTOM ON OUR SCREEN
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The starting point of the main axis is titled: MAIN START
</p>
<p>
  The end point of the main axis is titled: MAIN END 
</p>
<p>
  And the length from the main start to the main end is called:
  MAIN SIZE
</p>
<p>
  So in general we say that flex items FLOW from main start to main end 
  and take up the main size as the length
</p>
<p>
  Similarly with the cross axis we have the top which is called:
  CROSS START
</p>
<p>
  The bottom of the axis called: CROSS END
</p>
<p>
  And the distance between them is known as the: CROSS SIZE
</p>
<p>
  Understanding flexbox is getting familiar with the properties 
  associated with the flex container and the flex items, it's like 
  learning anything, learn what properties exist, and how they work / fit 
  together
</p>
<h2>
  So let's now go over all the properties that can be 
  applied to a flex container:
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
   <u> DISPLAY:</u> The display property defines the flex 
   container, and is mandatory to work with flexbox
  </li>
  <li>
    <u>
      FLEX-DIRECTION:
    </u>
    This defines the direction in which the flex-items are placed 
    within the container
  </li>
  <li>
    <u>
      FLEX-WRAP:
    </u>
This is used to control the wrapping of items in a container
  </li>
  <li>
    <u>
      FLEX-FLOW:

    </u>
    This is used as a shortcut for combining FLEX-WRAP & FLEX-DIRECTION
  </li>
  <li>
    <u>
      JUSTIFY CONTENT:
    </u>
    Defines the alignment of the items along the main (x) axis
  </li>
  <li>
    <u>
      ALIGN-ITEMS:
    </u>
    Defines how items are laid out along the cross (y) axis
  </li>
  <li>
    <u>
      ALIGN-CONTENT:
    </u>
    This is similar to justify-content, the difference being this 
    will align along the cross axis, instead of the main axis, BUT ALIGN-CONTENT 
    ONLY WORKS WHEN THERE ARE MULTIPLE ROWS OF FLEX-ITEMS IN THE CONTAINER
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Now let's take a closer look at these properties
</p>
<h2>
  DISPLAY
</h2>
<p>
  Okay so I just finished the exercise, we first set up a container 
  div in html with 9 divs, each with 'flex-item' and 'item 1' 
  through 'item 9', then used inline-flex to shift them all into 
  an inline flex container
