    <h1>
      These are notes I'll be taking for Vishwas Gopinath Udemy course, it's a
      short course but I'm looking forward to improving my flexbox skills
    </h1>
    <h2 class="mb-3">Course intro</h2>
    <p>
      Up first we'll go over what flexbox is, then in the rest of the course
      we'll practice using flexbox to built layouts
    </p>

    <h3>So what is flexbox?</h3>
    <p>
      The CSS flexible box module aka FLEXBOX is a one-dimensional 
      layout model that makes it easy to:
      <div class="parent">
        <ul>
        <li>
Design flexible and efficient layouts
      </li>
      <li>
        Distribute space among items
      </li>
      <li>
        Control their alignment in a given container
      </li>
    </ul>  
   
    </p>

    <p>
      Before flexbox there were four layout modes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <u>BLOCK</u> - For sections on a webpage
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>
          Inline
        </u>
         - For text
        
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>
          Table</u> - For two-dimensional table data
        
      </li>
      <li>
      <u>
        Positioned - 
      </u>
      For explicit position of an element
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But these layouts did not provide enough flexibility, we 
      used to have to use all sorts of 'hacks' to get the layout 
      the way we wanted, working with FLOATS, trying to VERTICALLY 
      ALIGN the content, creating EQUAL HEIGHT COLUMNS, kind've a 
      nightmare
    </p>
    <p>
      BOOTSTRAP is build on top of the flex layout, and FLEXBOX 
      itself is crucial to know for front-end developers in order 
      to style pages responsively
    </p>
    <p>Why flexbox?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Lot's of flexibility
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange items more efficiently
      </li>
      <li>
        Provide superior spacing
      </li>
      <li>
        Help maintain proper alignment and order of items
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
     <u> TERMINOLOGY: </u>
    </h2>
<p>
  When we talk about flexbox, we mainly mean two entities:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <u>
      FLEX-CONTAINER: Our main flex space
    </u>
  </li>
  <li>
    <u>
      FLEX-ITEMS: The immediate children elements of the flex container
    </u>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  For ex: if we have 'div class='container' and inside we have < div > 
  item 1 < / div > the 'item 1' is the flex-item, and the div class is 
  our flex container
</p>
<p>
  Now we also deal with FLEXBOX AXES
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    MAIN AXIS, or X AXIS WHICH RUNS LEFT TO RIGHT ON OUR SCREEN
  </li>
  <li>
    CROSS AXIS, or Y AXIS WHICH RUNS TOP TO BOTTOM ON OUR SCREEN
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The starting point of the main axis is titled: MAIN START
</p>
<p>
  The end point of the main axis is titled: MAIN END 
</p>
<p>
  And the length from the main start to the main end is called:
  MAIN SIZE
</p>
<p>
  So in general we say that flex items FLOW from main start to main end 
  and take up the main size as the length
</p>
<p>
  Similarly with the cross axis we have the top which is called:
  CROSS START
</p>
<p>
  The bottom of the axis called: CROSS END
</p>
<p>
  And the distance between them is known as the: CROSS SIZE
</p>
<p>
  Understanding flexbox is getting familiar with the properties 
  associated with the flex container and the flex items, it's like 
  learning anything, learn what properties exist, and how they work / fit 
  together
</p>
<h2>
  So let's now go over all the properties that can be 
  applied to a flex container:
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
   <u> DISPLAY:</u> The display property defines the flex 
   container, and is mandatory to work with flexbox
  </li>
  <li>
    <u>
      FLEX-DIRECTION:
    </u>
    This defines the direction in which the flex-items are placed 
    within the container
  </li>
  <li>
    <u>
      FLEX-WRAP:
    </u>
This is used to control the wrapping of items in a container
  </li>
  <li>
    <u>
      FLEX-FLOW:

    </u>
    This is used as a shortcut for combining FLEX-WRAP & FLEX-DIRECTION
  </li>
  <li>
    <u>
      JUSTIFY CONTENT:
    </u>
    Defines the alignment of the items along the main (x) axis
  </li>
  <li>
    <u>
      ALIGN-ITEMS:
    </u>
    Defines how items are laid out along the cross (y) axis
  </li>
  <li>
    <u>
      ALIGN-CONTENT:
    </u>
    This is similar to justify-content, the difference being this 
    will align along the cross axis, instead of the main axis, BUT ALIGN-CONTENT 
    ONLY WORKS WHEN THERE ARE MULTIPLE ROWS OF FLEX-ITEMS IN THE CONTAINER
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Now let's take a closer look at these properties
</p>
<h2>
  DISPLAY
</h2>
<p>
  Okay so I just finished the exercise, we first set up a container 
  div in html with 9 divs, each with 'flex-item' and 'item 1' 
  through 'item 9', then used inline-flex to shift them all into 
  an inline flex container
</p>
<h2>FLEX DIRECTION</h2>
<p>
  The next property we'll practice is flex direction, the 
  flex direction establishes the main axis, which in turn 
  establishes how the flex items are placed inside the flex 
  container
</p>
<p>
  By default, the main axis flows from left-to-right, by 
  changing the value of the flex-direction property, we can 
  alter how the items are placed inside of our container 
  div
</p>
<p>
  Okay just finished the exercise, after changing display: inline-block, 
  to display: flex, our div items widened to the full width 
  of the window, and the column, column-reverse, row, row-reverse
  all work
</p>
<h2>FLEX-WRAP</h2>
<p>
  Another very useful property on our container is: FLEX-WRAP,
 by default, all items inside of the flex container will try 
 to fit in a single line, if there's not enough space 
 the items will overflow
</p>
<p>
  So with flex-wrap, we have 3 possible values: nowrap, wrap, and 
  wrap reverse.
</p>

<p>
  With nowrap, nothing will change, as the browswer window 
  shrinks the container items will simply stay where they 
  are, and the shrunken window will obfuscate them, 
  but if we add 'wrap' the items will auto-sort inside 
  our container, and wrap-reverse does the same, except 
  in the opposite direction
</p>
<p>
  This also works with column, but it will shift our items 
  into a side-by-side column structure
</p>
<h2>FLEX-FLOW</h2>
<p>
  Flex-flow is shorthand for using both flex-direction, 
  and flex-wrap at once, so flex-flow combines the 
  two into one: flex-flow, and by default flex-flow 
  is set to 'row' and 'nowrap'
</p>
<p>
  So if we set  flex-flow: row-reverse wrap ; it 
  will combine the two, it's just a way of combining 
  the two, if we did flex-direction: row, and flex-wrap: 
  wrap, the exact same result would be achieved
</p>
<h2>
  justify-content
</h2>
<p>
  The justify-content property will change where our items 
  are inside of our container (x axis)
</p>
<h2>
  Align items
</h2>
<p>
  Align items determines where our items are on the y axis 
  our container
</p>
<p>
  If we set align-items: baseline, the container will position 
  the items based on the text, so if we have text of 
</p>
<h2>
  Flex Item properties
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    order
  </li>
  <p>
    The order property controls the order in which an item appears
    in the flex-container
  </p>
  <li>
    flex-grow
  </li>
  <p>
    The flex-grow property defines the ability for the flex-item
    to grow if necessary
  </p>
  <li>
    flex-shrink
  </li>
  <p>
    The flex-shrink property allows a flex-item to shrink if 
    necessary
  </p>
  <li>
    flex-basis
  </li>
  <p>
    The flex-basis property defines the initial main 
    size of a flex-item
  </p>
  <li>
    flex
  </li>
  <p>
    We'll also look at the flex property itself, which is shorthand for 
    all 3 (flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis)
  </p>
  <li>
    align-self
  </li>
  <p>
    Then we'll wrap up with the align-self, which allows alignment of 
    individual flex items
  </p>
</ul>
<h2>
  FLEX-ITEM PROPERTY: ORDER
</h2>
<p>
  Flex-items appear in the order they are written in the source code,
  this can be changed with the order property, we can use order on a specified 
  item in our css, if we have item5 in a list of 9 items, and we give it order: 1,
  it gets pushed to the end, this is because all of the other 8 items 
  have a default order set to 0, and 0 is less than 1, so item 5 now appears 
  after item9, and item 4 goes directly to item 6 because of the change
</p>
<p>
  The order property takes an integer value, and changes the order 
  of the items in the flex container
</p>
<h2>
  FLEX-ITEM PROPERTY: FLEX GROW
</h2>
<p>
  The flex property specifies what amount of space within the 
  flex container the item should take up if necessary, and 
  the flex grow factor is always relative to the size of the other 
  items in the flex container 
</p>
<p>
  This is often useful when you have extra space inside of a 
  given container, and you want the items to GROW to take up 
  the remaining space 
</p>
<p>
  By default all flex-items have a flex-grow value set to 0, this 
  is why they won't take up extra space if the container has any
</p>
<p>
  Also if we use flex-grow on all of our items, the extra space 
  will be evenly distributed among the flex items 
</p>
<p>
  We can also set flex-grow to different sizes on each item if 
  we'd like them to take up different amounts of space within 
  our container
</p>
<h2>
  FLEX-SHRINK
</h2>
<p>
  This property allows a flex-item to shrink if necessary, 
  the default value set to flex-shrink is 1, so if we have 
  a flex container with 5 items, and we set item4 to flex-shrink:2, 
  flex item4 will shrink 2x (twice) as fast as the other items, 
  if we set it to 3, it would shrink 3x as fast 
</p>
<h2>
  FLEX-BASIS
</h2>
<p>
  The flex-basis property defines the initial size of an item 
  inside of a container, BEFORE the extra space is distributed, 
  this is used instead of the 'width' property, use flex-basis 
  to set the initial width of the flex-item, flex-basis can use 
  pixel values, percentages, or relative units, and it's default 
  value is 'auto'
</p>
<h2>
  FLEX
</h2>
<p>
  This is a shorthand for all 3 (flex-grow, flex-shrink, and 
  flex-basis). If we have: .item{ flex-grow: 2; flex-shrink: 5; 
  flex-basis: 200px} we could just use flex and specify it like: 
  .item{ flex: 2 5 200px}, and by default the flex is set to: .item{
    flex: 0 1 auto;}
</p>
<h2>
  Align-self
</h2>
<p>
  This property is used to specify alignment of individual
  flex items 
</p>
